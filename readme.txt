Hello,
I have created a website with the help of HTML, CSS, JS in the frontend and have used Firebase for the backend.
to login you can either create a new Email ID and password or can use the sample email ID and password.
Sample Email ID: user@gmail.com
       Password: user123
Hope you like the project.
Thank you!
